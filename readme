Project Scope Document
1.	Project Summary
Today’s customers may want touse self-service to answer common questions and learn best practices. They may need to connect directly with an operator or a human assistant or may even require field service. The aim of this project is when a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.In this project, there will be another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of “Would you like to speak to a customer representative?” we can return relevant sections of the owners manual to help solve our customers’ problems
